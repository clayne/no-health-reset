[heading]Updating[/heading]
It is safe to update to a newer release in the middle of a game, as long as the first number ([i]major[/i] version) doesn't change:
&#8203;
[list]
[*] [b]1.0.0[/b] → [b]1.0.2[/b] ✔️
[*] [b]1.0.1[/b] → [b]1.0.2[/b] ✔️[/list]
Also see [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101821]Semantic Versioning for End-User Game Mods[/url].
&#8203;

[heading]Configuration[/heading]
The following property of the [code]_p7NHR_Quest[/code] quest can be edited using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url] or the console:
&#8203;
[list]
[*][code][b]Float[/b] SleepHealingMult[/code] (default: [b]2.0[/b]): multiplies the health amount recovered by sleeping.[/list]
Also see the [i]Implementation Details[/i] section below.
&#8203;

[heading]Implementation Details[/heading]
Health after sleep is calculated as:
[quote][code]newHealth = oldHealth + baseHealth * SleepHealingMult * HealRate / 100 * HealRateMult / 100 * 60 * 60 * hours / TimeScale[/code]
[/quote] where:
• [code]newHealth[/code] is the value after sleeping;
• [code]oldHealth[/code] is the value before sleeping;
• [code]baseHealth[/code] is the value without damage;
• [code]SleepHealingMult[/code] (default: [b]2.0[/b]) is a [code]float[/code] property of the [code]_p7NHR_Quest[/code] quest, chosen so that sleeping and waiting restore the same amount;
• [code]HealRate[/code] (default: [b]0.70[/b]) is an actor value affecting [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Health#Passive_Regeneration]regeneration[/url];
• [code]HealRateMult[/code] (default: [b]100[/b]) is another actor value affecting regeneration;
• [code]hours[/code] is the time spent sleeping;
• [code]TimeScale[/code] (default: [b]20[/b]) is a global variable determining [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console#set_timescale]how [i]game time[/i] passes compared to [i]real time[/i][/url].
&#8203;
Note that [code]TimeScale[/code] affects the amount of health restored: since [code]HealRate[/code] and [code]HealRateMult[/code] determine the percentage of [code]baseHealth[/code] recovered in [i]real time[/i] seconds, a lower value of [code]TimeScale[/code] makes the same amount of health recover over a shorter lapse of [i]game time[/i]. The same can be observed when waiting in vanilla game, as long as the regeneration rate is low enough.
&#8203;

[heading]Known Issues[/heading]
[list]
[*] Sleeping can cause death when the regeneration rate is below zero.
&#8203;
This can occur with effects which further decrease health regeneration, such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163]Frostfall[/url] exposure or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51473]iNeed[/url] hunger, and is not consistent with how the game handles negative rates, but was left as a motivation to treat those conditions before resting.[/list]

[heading]Alternatives[/heading]
[list]
[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55507]Realistic Regeneration[/url] applies custom regeneration rates to sleep.[/list]

[heading]Errata[/heading]
[list]
[*] This page incorrectly reported a similar feature was included in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281]Requiem[/url] until version [b]2.0.2[/b]: instead [url=https://requiem.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RS/pages/794656953/Requiem+3.4.0+-+The+Shadow+Theory]the changelog reports[/url] it was removed since version [b]3.4.0[/b].[/list]
