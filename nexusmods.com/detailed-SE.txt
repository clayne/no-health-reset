This is intended to work with any mod which reduces or zeroes health regeneration, such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15447]No More Passive Health Regeneration[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14437]Realistic Regeneration - RealRegen[/url].

It can also be used to emulate a similar feature present in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281]Requiem[/url] [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/axou15/requiem_news_requiem_300_consign_to_oblivion_is/ehxmwai]until version 2.0.2[/url], for instance if using a port to Special Edition, for which the corresponding SKSE plugin was not converted, or a later release, in which [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/axou15/requiem_news_requiem_300_consign_to_oblivion_is/ehxmwai]the feature was removed[/url].

[b]Requirements[/b]

[list]
[*] [url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url].
[*] A mod or tweak to decrease health regeneration, since vanilla rate wouldn't allow to appreciate the effects of this mod.
Examples include, but are not limited to:
[list]
[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15447]No More Passive Health Regeneration[/url];
[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14437]Realistic Regeneration - RealRegen[/url];
[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281]Requiem[/url];
[*] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33395]SkyTweak[/url];
[*] using [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console#Targeted_Commands]modAV in console[/url] to reduce [i]HealRate[/i];
[*] directly modifying [i]Health Regen[/i] in the [url=https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Race]Race[/url] record.[/list][/list]

[b]Installation[/b]

[list]
[*] Use your mod manager of choice, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194]Mod Organizer 2[/url] is recommended.[/list]

[b]Updating[/b]

It is safe to update to a newer release in the middle of a game, as long as the first number ([i]major[/i] version) doesn't change; the following is supported:

[list]
[*] [b]1[/b].0.0 → [b]1[/b].0.1[/list]
See [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101821]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101821[/url] for more details.


[b]Features[/b]

[list]
[*] After sleep, health is reverted to its previous state; any regeneration rate [i]HealRate[/i] is accounted for the hours spent sleeping.
[*] After level up, health is reverted to its previous state; additionally, if it was chosen as the attribute to increment, such a difference is added back.[/list]

[b]Known Issues[/b]

[list]
[*] Health can be reduced to lower than the initial value, possibly causing death, when the resulting regeneration rate is below zero: for example this is the case when combining the effect of a mod above with the penalty for high exposure given by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163]Frostfall[/url].
Note that this is not consistent with how the game handles a negative value of regeneration, since it wouldn't cause additional health damage; nonetheless I left this side effect as an incentive for players to restore their condition before going to sleep.[/list]
