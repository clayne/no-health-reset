* set health value after sleeping according to HealRate;
* NOTE: value is calculated as: healthBeforeSleeping + hoursSlept * 60 * 60 * HealRate * HealRateMult / 100 / 10, it is not clear why it is necessary to divide by 10 to get the desired value;
* NOTE: HealRateMult is undocumented in the CK;
* NOTE: health is set to an unexpected value after waiting:
- it went from 10.0 to about 20.0 after 8 hours waiting with HealRate set to usual 0.000827 and HealRateMult somewhere in 30.0, 70.0 or 100.0 (not sure which one was applied because of hunger or thirst effects);
- sometimes you could see it getting damaged after a few seconds;
* TODO: check
- waiting works correctly without this mod;
- OnSleepStart and OnSleepStop code shouldn't be executed when waiting.
